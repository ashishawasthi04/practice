/*
 * Description 1:
 * Youâ€™re given an elevation map for a rectangular area of land. The map is represented by 2-D array of numbers where
 * each cell contains the elevation above sea level of the corresponding area of the map.
 * You need a path that connects the west edge of the map with the east edge of the map.
 * Starting at the west edge of the map you can only move in single cell steps east, southeast, or northeast.
 * You need to find how much can the sea level rise before submerging all such paths.
 * Write a function that takes in a 2-D array and returns a single number.
 * west         east
 * ----------------- north
 * | 1 | 2 | 3 | 9 |

 * | 8 | 6 | 10| 8 |

 * | 9 | 4 | 11| 12|

/**
 * Description 2:
 * Given a 2-d array of "sharpness" values. Find a path from the leftmost column to the rightmost column which has
 * the highest minimum sharpness.
 * Output the highest minimum sharpness. Each move can only move to the top right, right or bottom right grid.
 * Example: 3*3 matrix
 * 5 7 2
 * 7 5 8
 * 9 1 5
 * The path with the highest minimum sharpness is 7-->7-->8, because 7 is the highest minimum value in all the paths.

    Follow-up:
    If the matrix is very large:
    - Can process the matrix in horizontal strips, minding the boundary of the strip depends on the previous and next strips.
    - Or you can read it column by column each time (many disk seek() because of the way array is stored).
    Helps to have it stored in random access files
    - Or transpose the file: same if read row, output col, many disk seek() when written;
    - if read col, output row, many disk seek() when read
    - we can according to the memory size, each time read a square matrix, and do the transpose of it.
    - Then do the processing row by row.
